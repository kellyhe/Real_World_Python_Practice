Outward appearance
In the books, Hermione is described as having "bushy brown hair"[37][38][39] and brown eyes.[40] Her front buck teeth, already very large,[37][39] grow uncontrollably in Goblet of Fire after she is affected by a spell cast by Draco Malfoy.[41] Madam Pomfrey attends to her in the hospital wing and, at her request, shrinks the teeth down to a normal size that matches her mouth.[42] In the films, her hair is less bushy and she always has regular teeth.
There is controversy[43] over whether Hermione's skin color was ever categorically established in the books. Some take as proof a line from Prisoner of Azkaban: "Hermione's white face was sticking out from behind a tree."[44] They interpret this to be a direct description of her skin color. Others interpret it as a description relative to her usual complexion, arising due to fright and anxiety as she watches Harry Potter's attempt to save the hippogriff Buckbeak from execution. J.K. Rowling herself states that Hermione "turned white" in that she "lost colour from her face after a shock."[43]
Conversely, another description from early in Prisoner of Azkaban can also be cited: "They were there, both of them, sitting outside Florean Fortescue's Ice-Cream Parlour, Ron looking incredibly freckly, Hermione very brown, both waving frantically at him."[45] Some claim that this is a direct description of her skin color, while others claim that it's a relative description of the results of a tan acquired over the summer break.
Personality
Hermione's most prominent features include her prodigious intellect and cleverness. She is levelheaded, book-smart, and always very logical. Throughout the series, Hermione uses the skills of a librarian and teacher to gather the information necessary to defeat Voldemort, the "Dark Lord". When in doubt, it is to the school library that Hermione always turns.[46] She is often bossy yet unfailingly dutiful and loyal to her friends—a person who can always be counted on. J.K. Rowling stated that Hermione is a person that, "never strays off the path; she always keeps her attention focused on the job that must be done."[47] Despite Hermione's intelligence and bossy attitude, Rowling says that Hermione has "quite a lot of vulnerability in her personality,"[48] as well as a "sense of insecurity underneath," feels, "utterly inadequate... and to compensate, she tries and strives to be the best at everything at school, projecting a confidence that irritates people."[49] During her Defence Against the Dark Arts exam at the end of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Hermione reveals that her biggest fear is failure after a Boggart takes the form of Professor McGonagall and tells her that she has failed all her exams.
Hermione is extremely compassionate and is very quick to help others, especially those who are defenceless, such as Neville Longbottom, first-years, House-Elves, fellow Muggle-borns, half-giants like Hagrid, and werewolves like Lupin. It was revealed by J.K. Rowling after the publication of the final book that Hermione's career in the Ministry was to fight for the rights of the oppressed and disenfranchised (such as House-elves or Muggle-borns). Hermione is also very protective of her friends and values them so much that Rowling has suggested that, if Hermione had looked in the Mirror of Erised, she would have seen Harry, Ron, and herself "alive and unscathed, and Voldemort finished."[50] Hermione has also learned to ignore what bullies such as Draco Malfoy say to her, often preventing Harry and Ron from retaliating and thinking of some way to outsmart him. She accepts her status as a Muggle-born witch, and states in Deathly Hallows that she is "a Mudblood and proud of it".[51]
Magical abilities and skills
Hermione is portrayed during the whole series as an exceptionally talented young witch. J.K. Rowling has stated that Hermione is a "borderline genius."[52] She received ten O.W.L.s, which were nine Outstandings and one Exceeds Expectations. She is the best student in Harry's year and is repeatedly the first student to master any spell or charm introduced in her classes and even from more advanced years, as evidenced when she can conjure a Protean Charm on the D.A.'s fake Galleon coins, which is a N.E.W.T. level charm.[53] She is also the first one of her age to be able to cast non-verbal spells.[54] Hermione is a competent duellist – Rowling has stated that while during the first three books Hermione could have beaten Harry in any magical duel, but by the fourth book Harry had become so good at Defence Against the Dark Arts that he would have defeated Hermione.[55] Hermione did not tend to do as well in subjects that were not learned through books or formal training, as broom flying did not come as naturally to her in her first year as it did to Harry,[56] and she showed no affinity for Divination, which she dropped from her third-year studies.[57][58] She was also not good at Wizard's Chess, as it was the only thing at which she ever lost to Ron.[59]
Hermione's Patronus is an otter, Rowling's favourite animal. In the Deathly Hallows book, while they enter the Ministry of Magic under disguise, Hermione impersonates Mafalda Hopkirk. It is also stated that conjuring a Patronus is the only thing she ever has trouble with.[60] Her wand is made of vine wood and dragon heartstring core; vine is the wood ascribed to Hermione's fictional birth month (September) on the Celtic calendar.[61]
