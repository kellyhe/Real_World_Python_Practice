Physical appearance
"She had straggly, waist-length, dirty blonde hair, very pale eyebrows, and protuberant eyes that gave her a permanently surprised look."
— Description of Luna's physical appearance[src]
In 1997, sixteen-year-old Luna had waist-length, straggly, dirty blonde hair,[8] protuberant silvery eyes,[9] which often seemed to be dreamily distracted, and faint eyebrows. She had an aura of "distinct dottiness" about her,[7] and was known to put her wand behind her left ear for safekeeping.
Luna had a unique fashion sense that other people usually found bizarre. She often wore odd pieces of jewellery such as a Butterbeer cork necklace and Dirigible plum earrings, and in 1996, a pair of Spectrespecs.[6] Luna also did not wear shoes because students in her house would take her shoes and hide them.[5]
At Hogwarts Quidditch matches, Luna supported Gryffindor against every House except Ravenclaw; to show her support for Gryffindor, she would wear a hat in the shape of a lion head that roars, and to show support for Ravenclaw she would wear an eagle hat with flapping wings.[5] At Professor Slughorn's Christmas party in 1996, she wore spangled silver robes.[6] At Bill Weasley and Fleur Delacour's wedding, she wore bright yellow robes because she was taught it brought luck to a wedding to wear sun colours and had a sunflower in her hair, as well.[12] She was described as "pretty" on some occasions, despite her odd clothes.
Personality and traits
"Luna was once again demonstrating her usual knack of speaking of uncomfortable truths; he had never met anyone quite like her."
— Luna's unusual character traits[src]
Luna was an extremely quirky girl, with a serene disposition and many eccentric beliefs and qualities. She was a complete nonconformist; she lacked self-consciousness and was not afraid to show who she truly was. Luna was also intelligent and unusually perceptive, having been sorted into Ravenclaw[5] "where those of wit and learning will always find their kind." A prime example of Luna’s perceptiveness was when she pointed out the ironically drastic measures taken against Sirius Black when he escaped Azkaban, but when ten Death Eaters (including Bellatrix Lestrange) escaped, barely any measures were taken to recapture them.
Although many thought Luna was bizarre, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, Dean Thomas and Ollivander eventually became very fond of her.[6]
Luna's demeanour and voice were often distant and dreamy; she would drift away from a conversation she did not find interesting. However, whenever someone made fun of her father or his magazine The Quibbler, the dreamy quality in her voice would vanish and be replaced by one of steel, and she would immediately become very angry. She had an uncanny way of making others uncomfortable by being bluntly honest — Harry Potter described her as having a "knack for embarrassing honesty". She was also completely unflappable and rarely seemed anxious or stressed, even under difficult circumstances such as being a prisoner of Malfoy Manor. Luna was very good at comforting others. She comforted Harry after his godfather's death[5] and Mr Ollivander while they were imprisoned together.[12]
Luna was often the subject of ridicule and had difficulty making friends. Other students gave her the nickname of "Loony Lovegood" and even stole and hid her things. She was unfazed by this, and instead chose to be nonjudgmental and accepting of those around her.[5] She once said that she did not like dancing much, though she did dance some at the wedding of Bill and Fleur, along with her father.
Luna seemed to have enjoyed artistic pursuits in her free time; her house was filled with various things that she painted.[12] She even painted very life-like portraits of her friends that seemed to breathe. Luna was very loyal to the few friends she had — she published Rita Skeeter's interview of Harry Potter on The Quibbler (March issue, 1996)[23] during the latter's fifth year and supported Harry even when he was outlawed by the Ministry of Magic. Ron stated that she certainly has far more courage than her father, who was at the time stressed when under duress. She also displayed admirable bravery during both the Battle of the Department of Mysteries and the Battle of Hogwarts.
Magical abilities and skills
Luna was shown to be a very talented and powerful witch. At the age of fourteen, she was able to conjure a corporeal Patronus — a very advanced piece of magic and proof that she possessed superior magical ability.[24]
"I’ve never Stunned anyone except in our DA lessons. That was noisier than I thought it would be."

	▪	Defence Against the Dark Arts: As a committed member of Dumbledore's Army, Luna learned how to cast numerous defensive and offensive spells under the instruction of Harry Potter.[5] Luna demonstrated her excellent defensive abilities by fighting in both the Battle of the Department of Mysteries, Battle of the Astronomy Tower and the Battle of Hogwarts against numerous Death Eaters, and surviving all of them.
	▪	Duelling: Despite her young age, Luna was a very competent duellist. At the age of fifteen, she participated in and survived the Battle of the Department of Mysteries with no more than a few minor injuries. She also emerged from the Battle of the Astronomy Tower with no major injuries. During the Battle of Hogwarts she, Hermione, and Ginny duelled against the notorious Bellatrix Lestrange and emerged as one of the survivors.
	▪	Charms: In her fourth year, Luna learned how to conjure a corporeal Patronus in the form of a hare,[12][25] which is an incredibly advanced, powerful and protective charm, as well as a mark of superior magical ability and talent, showing her proficiency for charm-work. She could also cast simple charms such as the Locking Spell, Reductor Curse, Stunning Spell, Levitation Charm, Revelio Charm, General Counter-Spell and Wand-Lighting Charm successfully without difficulty.
	▪	Nonverbal magic: In 1998, Luna wordlessly stunned the Death Eater Alecto Carrow with the Stunning Spell, while inside Ravenclaw Tower.[12] The fact that she could effectively cast it nonverbally is a testament of sorts to her skill, since non-verbal magic is highly difficult, N.E.W.T.-level magic.
	▪	Care of Magical Creatures: She may have studied this subject at Hogwarts. As an adult Luna became a famous Magizoologist, a wizarding naturalist. She discovered and classified many species that had never been encountered before.[14] She was also shown to be very skilled at handling various magical creatures, such as Thestrals, showing her proficiency in Magizoology.
	▪	Study of Ancient Runes: In the July/August edition of The Quibbler in 1995, Luna was able to read that issue's segment written in Ancient runes upside down, heavily implying she was able to understand and translate such runes. This also implies that she may have studied the subject at Hogwarts.[7]
	▪	Creativity: Luna was a very creative and artistic witch. She invented a lion-shaped hat that, with a tap of a wand, made a realistic roar, and she made a flapping eagle hat of the same kind. She also painted on her bedroom's ceiling the portraits of Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger, Ginny Weasley, and Neville Longbottom, woving them with a "chain" consisting of a single word, "friends", "repeated a thousand of times in golden ink",[26] and it is suggested that she painted birds, flowers and insects on the walls of the kitchen of her family house.[27] All of this show her impressive skills as an artist.
	▪	Leadership skills: At the age of sixteen, Luna co-led Dumbledore's Army along with her friends, Ginny and Neville. Their leadership was so efficient that she was abducted in an attempt to force the resistance to surrender, though she was ultimately rescued by Harry and Ron.
